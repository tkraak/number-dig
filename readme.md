## Number Digger

Write a function that takes 2 arguments, an integer `n` and a digit `d`. Square all numbers `k` between `0` and `n` and count the number of digits `d` used in the `k` squares.

 * `n` - integer (`n >= 0`)
 * `d` - digit (`0 <= d <= 9`)

## Example

 * `n = 10`
 * `d = 1`
 * the `k` squares are `0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100`
 * `d` of `1` appears in `1, 16, 81, 100`
 * therefore, count is `4`
